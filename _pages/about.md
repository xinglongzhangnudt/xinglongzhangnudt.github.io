I am an Associate Professor at the College of Intelligence Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China. I receieved my PhD degree in System and Control from Politecnico di Milano, Italy!

My research interests include Koopman operators, learning-based predictive control, reinforcement learning, and their applications in robotics and autonomous systems.
